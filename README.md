# 👋 Hi, I'm João Vitor

I'm a Brazilian software developer with 5+ years of experience building scalable backend systems using .NET. I’ve worked abroad through a consultancy and currently focus on cross-platform development with Flutter and cloud computing with AWS.

I'm passionate about writing clean, maintainable code and applying solid principles to build software that lasts.
